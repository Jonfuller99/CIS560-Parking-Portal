Project Summary:
The parking pass portal is a web-based system that will allow users and officers to manage parking passes and parking violations. The portal supports different types of passes, each assigned to specific parking lots to ensure proper access control. Violations occur when vehicles park in restricted lots without the appropriate pass. Users can access the portal to buy passes and settle outstanding ticket violations. Officers use the portal to issue tickets and view statistics.
